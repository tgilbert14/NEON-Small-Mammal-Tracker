# Small Mammal History Application: 
This a shiny application that that uses National Ecological Observatory Network (https://data.neonscience.org/) data to compare small mammal capture data across various NEON sites. This app uses capture data based on a location and date range selection, then ranks them in order of total number captures by identifying tags of individuals.
## After initial selection:
Then the app prompts the user to select a tag from the list to look at in depth statistics of specific animal selected (by TagID) such as raw collection data from capture events, meso-measurements and heat maps of trap location where species was found at. This app also generates a URL that links the NEON Biorepository based on the species of the selected tag as well as creates a summary map of captures and capture per plot graphs for all captures at all plots for selected site and date range.
